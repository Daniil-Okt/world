                <p class="right-about__text">World Entertainment is aiming to launch similar events on land, at seafront 
                    and ocean front hotels. We are expecting high attendance from the same category of the music-loving public who go on music cruises.</p>
                <p class="right-about__text">We believe this is a natural next step in the evolution of music events. 
                    These events will be collectively named "Music On The Beach". Currently we are concentrating on launching a maiden event of this kind in Antalya, Turkey.</p>
                <p class="right-about__text-bold">Please get in touch by e-mail or What’sApp with any questions. We should be happy to hear from you.</p>
